    <h1>Tiffany Parkinson</h1>
    <p>I am a finalizing Computer Science Major. My favorite color is purple
        and after attaining my degree, I intend to pursue an associates degree
        in Veterinary Medicine. My passion does not necessarily lie within my 
        current studies, but it is still interesting nontheless to learn new things.
